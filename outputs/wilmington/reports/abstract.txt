Compound flooding from concurrent river discharge and coastal storm surge
poses an escalating threat to North Carolina's estuarine communities.
Current early warning systems rely solely on observed water levels,
providing limited lead time for emergency response.

This project develops a physics-informed Compound Flood Risk Index (CFRI)
that combines upstream river discharge with local water level measurements,
accounting for the natural lag between river flow and coastal response.
Using 30 years of hourly hydrological data for wilmington,
we identified 40 flood events and systematically evaluated
CFRI predictive performance.

The CFRI achieved an F1 score of 0.264, representing a
275.4% improvement over the water-level-only baseline
(F1 = 0.070). Most critically, CFRI provided an average
of 61.3 hours of advance warning before flood onset,
enabling proactive emergency management decisions.

The methodology employs rigorous train/test temporal validation
to prevent data leakage and ensure realistic performance estimates.
This physics-informed approach demonstrates that incorporating
river-coast coupling dynamics significantly improves flood prediction
in estuarine settings, with direct applications for coastal resilience
and emergency preparedness in North Carolina.
